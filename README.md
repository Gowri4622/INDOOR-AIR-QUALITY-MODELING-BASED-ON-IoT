# INDOOR AIR QUALITY MODELING BASED ON IoT
The purpose of this report is to provide an overview of indoor air quality (IAQ) modeling based on Internet of Things (IoT) technologies.

## Objective
The objective of this project a real-time model to monitor and control the indoor air quality.

## Abstract
In this work, a novel method is implemented using sensor fusion to make a quick and efficient response in air quality control using inlet flow control of air through a filtered channel.

## Methodology

#### Indoor Air Quality Index (IAQI) includes 

+ Integrating the pollutants.
+ Gathering the standards.
+ Selecting the monitoring Location.
+ Installing sensor fusion.
+ Calculating, Aggregating, and Interpreting IAQI.

#### Indoor Air Modeling includes

## Result
The integration of sensors with IoT system was implemented and the output data has been collected and validated through the system. Thus an intelligent algorithm to model the IAQ based on industry standards was developed and the results through standard test cases are tested and validated.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, our project on predicting and modeling indoor air quality has
highlighted the importance of creating healthier indoor environments. By leveraging a comprehensive methodology that includes data collection, preprocessing, feature selection, and employing advanced modeling techniques such as LSTM, we have developed accurate IAQ prediction models.
